# Accordion

The Accordion component allows users to expand and collapse content sections.

## Default

This is the default state of the Accordion component:

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} height="30vh" />

## Component Properties

{/* Controls without 'of' uses the Meta context */}
<Controls />

## Usage

```svelte
<Accordion 
  isOpen={false} 
  data={[
    { title: "Heading 1", text: "Sample text content for heading 1" },
    { title: "Heading 2", text: "Sample text content for heading 2" },
    { title: "Heading 3", text: "Sample text content for heading 3" }
  ]} 
/>
```

## Behavior

The Accordion component facilitates organization of content in collapsible sections.
Each section can be expanded or collapsed independently.

## Design Considerations

This component follows Garnet UI's visual style, with the following characteristics:

- Subtle elevation and shadow effects when expanding sections
- Smooth transitions to enhance user experience
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
