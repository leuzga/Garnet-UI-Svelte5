## Breadcrumbs

The Breadcrumbs component provides users with navigational context by displaying a hierarchical path of pages they have visited. It serves as a secondary navigation pattern that helps users understand their current location within the application's structure and easily navigate back to previous levels.
Features

* Clear visual path showing the user's navigation history
* Clickable links to previously visited pages
* Customizable separator between navigation items
* Option to include icons for enhanced visual cues
* Accessible navigation with appropriate ARIA attributes

## Functionality
The Breadcrumbs component tracks and displays the user's journey through the application, enabling them to:

Understand their current location in the application hierarchy
Navigate back to higher-level pages with a single click
Maintain orientation within complex multi-level applications
Reduce the number of steps needed to navigate between related sections

## Usage
The Breadcrumbs component is particularly useful in:

* Multi-level navigation structures
* Applications with hierarchical content organization
* Dashboards or portals with multiple sections
* E-commerce interfaces with category navigation
* Document management systems

## Design Considerations

This component follows Garnet UI's visual style, with the following characteristics:

* Subtle elevation and shadow effects when appropriate
* Smooth transitions to enhance user experience
* Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
* Consistent spacing between breadcrumb items for improved readability
* Limited color palette to maintain visual hierarchy
* Clear visual distinction between active and clickable items
* Compact presentation to minimize vertical space consumption
* Truncation of long item names on smaller screens
* High contrast ratios to ensure accessibility
* Appropriate hover and focus states for interactive elements
