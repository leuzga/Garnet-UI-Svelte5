# Alarm

The Alarm component allows users to display notification counters with a bell icon that animates to attract attention.

## Component Variations

<Stories includePrimary={true} title="" />

## Component Properties

{/* Controls without 'of' uses the Meta context */}
<Controls />

## Usage

```svelte
<Alarm 
  notifications={23}
  label="Notifications"
  countColor="#733635"
  countBackgroundColor="#f4f4f4"
  filled={false}
  small={false}
/>
```

## Behavior

The Alarm component displays a notification count alongside a bell icon. When there are notifications present, the bell icon animates with a gentle ringing effect to draw attention. The component can be configured to show different visual states through props like `filled` and `small`, and the appearance can be customized with color props.

## Design Considerations

This component follows Garnet UI's visual style, with the following characteristics:

- Subtle elevation and shadow effects when appropriate
- Smooth transitions to enhance user experience
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Animated bell provides visual feedback when notifications are present
- Clear visual hierarchy between the notification count and the bell icon
